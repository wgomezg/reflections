was introduced?

Because you can explore the file to find some differences in the write words.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

Because it is possible roll back mistakes or offer one previous version of the code.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

You have the control of the changes and you can decide when is the correct moment to do that.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because git is oriented to project (many files in the same project), Google Docs is oriented to document

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

I can review all coommits and take his id and compare with another id to see the changes between.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

Because I have the possibility to rollback to another working stage of my development

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
